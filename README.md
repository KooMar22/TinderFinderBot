# TinderFinderBot
This is a simple Tinder Finder Bot script that automatically logs into Tinder and finds (likes) Tinder profiles for you.

For every fifth profile, this script also dislikes one profile in order for it to look more "human". You can configure this to your liking within the script.

Of course, my credentials are protected and I advise you to do the same (e.g. within ".env" file).
If you put it directly into the script, make sure not to share it with anyone else.
